# Bonsai Interview Test

 
Here are some features that are implemented to the app:
 - Clicking Buy does SOMETHING! This should add data to the database in a meaningful way and communicate to the user that such an action took place.
 - Ability to select a quantity to buy. The quantity should be stored in the database in a meaningful way, this data should be retrieved and displayed somewhere for the user.
 - Add a profile page to display user-related data. This data should be stored in the database and retrieved.
 - User Authenication
 - Select multiple items to buy together. Which items get selected/submitted should be stored meaningfully in the database.
 - Add a cart object to display selected items the user wants to buy. Store this information meaningfully in the database.
